# Flatten Binary Tree to Linked List

![Difficulty](https://img.shields.io/badge/Difficulty-Medium-yellow)

## Problem

Given the root of a binary tree, flatten the tree into a Linked list:

- The linked list should use the same Node class where the right child pointer points to the next node in the list and the left child pointer is always null.
- The linked list nodes should be in the same order as a preorder traversal of the binary tree.

 **Examples:** 

```
Input: root[] = [1, 2, 5, 3, 4, 6]

Output: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]  
Explanation: After flattening, the tree looks like:
     1
      \
       2
        \
         3
          \
           4
            \ 
             5 
              \
               6
Here, left of each node points to NULL and right contains the next node in preorder.The inorder traversal of this flattened tree is 1 2 3 4 5 6.
```

```
Input: root[] = [1, 3, 4, 2, 5]

Output: [1, 3, 4, 2, 5] 
Explanation: After flattening, the tree looks like:
     1
      \
       3
        \
         4
          \
           2
            \ 
             5 
Here, left of each node points to NULL and right contains the next node in preorder.The inorder traversal of this flattened tree is 1 3 4 2 5.
```

 
 **Constraints :** 
1<= number of nodes in binary tree <= 105
1<= data of nodes <= 105

```cpp
/* Binary Tree Node Structure
class Node {
public:
    int data;
    Node* left;
    Node* right;

    Node(int data) {
        this->data = data;
        left = right = nullptr;
    }
};
*/

class Solution {
  public:
    void flatten(Node* root) {
        // code here
        Node* curr = root;
        
        while(curr != NULL){
            
            if(curr -> left ){
                Node* pred = curr -> left;
                while(pred -> right){
                    pred = pred-> right;
                }
                pred ->right = curr -> right;
                curr -> right = curr -> left;
                curr -> left = NULL;
            }
            curr = curr-> right;
            
        }
    }
};
```
